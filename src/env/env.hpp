/**
 * @page envvars Environment Variables
 *
 * @envvar{ARGO_MEMORY_SIZE} request a specific memory size in bytes
 * @details This environment variable is only used if argo::init() is called with no
 *          argo_size parameter (or it has value 0). It can be accessed through
 *          @ref argo::env::memory_size() after argo::env::init() has been called.
 *
 * @envvar{ARGO_CACHE_SIZE} request a specific cache size in bytes
 * @details This environment variable is only used if argo::init() is called with no
 *          cache_size parameter (or it has value 0). It can be accessed through
 *          @ref argo::env::cache_size() after argo::env::init() has been called.
 *
 * @envvar{ARGO_WRITE_BUFFER_SIZE} request a specific write buffer size in cache blocks
 * @details This environment variable defaults to 512 cache blocks if not specified.
 *          It can be accessed through @ref argo::env::write_buffer_size() after
 *          argo::env::init() has been called.
 *
 * @envvar{ARGO_WRITE_BUFFER_WRITE_BACK_SIZE} request a specific write buffer write
 * back size in cache blocks.
 * @details This environment variable defaults to 32 cache blocks if not specified.
 *          It can be accessed through @ref argo::env::write_buffer_write_back_size()
 *          after argo::env::init() has been called.
 * 
 * @envvar{ARGO_ALLOCATION_POLICY} request a specific allocation policy with a number
 * @details This environment variable can be accessed through
 *          @ref argo::env::allocation_policy() after argo::env::init() has been called.
 * 
 * @envvar{ARGO_ALLOCATION_BLOCK_SIZE} request a specific allocation block size in number of pages
 * @details This environment variable can be accessed through
 *          @ref argo::env::allocation_block_size() after argo::env::init() has been called.
 *
 * @envvar{ARGO_LOAD_SIZE} request a specific load size in number of pages
 * @details This environment variable determines the maximum amount of DSM pages that
 * 			are fetched on each remote load operation. It can be accessed through
 *          @ref argo::env::load_size() after argo::env::init() has been called.
 *
 * @envvar{ARGO_MPI_WINDOWS_PER_NODE} request a specific number of MPI Windows
 * @details This environment variable determines the amount of MPI windows that are
 * 			used to protect the global data and pyxis data structures. Each structure
 * 			uses the requested number of MPI windows per node, multiplied by the
 * 			number of nodes in the system. It can be accessed through
 * 			@ref argo::env::mpi_windows_per_node() after argo::env::init() has been called.
 *
 * @envvar{ARGO_PRINT_STATISTICS} control the detail of statistics printed at end
 * @details This environment variable determines the amount of statistics printed at once
 * 			ArgoDSM finalizes. 0 prints no statistics, 1 prints general system information,
 * 			2 in addition prints basic node information, and 3 in addition prints detailed
 * 			node information. It can be accessed through @ref argo::env::print_statistics()
 * 			after argo::env::init() has been called.
